# Photovoltaics analysis and time-series forecasting.

The aim of this project is to:
1. Analyse the performance of two solar panels in India over a 35 day period.
2. Forecast DC Power output over the next 7 day period, by variables that have the strongest correlation with DC Power.

The dataset used in this analysis was downloaded from Kaggle.

The contents of the jupyer notebook are as follows:
1. Exploration analysis, visualisations and statistical testing of the power generation and sensor data.
2. Performance Evaluation of the two PV panels.
3. Forecast of DC Power output by Irradiation, Module Temperature and Time, with comparison between the ARIMA, Seasonal ARIMA and XGBoost model.
